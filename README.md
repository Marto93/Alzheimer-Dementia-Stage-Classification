# Alzheimer-Dementia-Stage-Classification

This project aimed to develop a model able to distinguish between 4 different phases of Alzheimer Dementia. The main task proposed in Kaggle competition was to optimize or to develop a model able to overcome the already achieved results on that dataset of about 90% accuracy. The dataset is composed of ~ 5000 images of structural MRI images collected from different website (with verified labeling). The different stages to recognize are:

- Non Demented
- Very Mild Demented
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented

 I decided not to use an already existing architecture, and to implement my CNN from scratch.
